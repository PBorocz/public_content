# My Emacs Configuration

Iâ€™ve been happily using Emacs since 1990 (really, see some of my history at the bottom of config.org), however, only recently have I deemed my configuration _suitable_ for public display.

While I tend to be a start Emacs _fresh every morning_ kind-of-guy, my startup times continued to ramp-up and become rather annoying.

Given that one of key capabilities of Emacs is [Org mode](https://orgmode.org), in evaluating a ground-up rebuild of my configuration, it seemed a shame not to take advantage of Org's capabilities to ease maintenance of said configuration.

Thus, while `init.el` sets up a few initial GUI settings, bootstraps `use-package`, and loads (well, more accurately "_tangles_") config.org, 99% of my configuration can be found here:

[**Config.org**](https://github.com/PBorocz/.emacs.d/blob/trunk/config.org)

**NOTE**:  I am NOT an elisp programmer (to me, Emacs is a tool, ie. like my bandsaw I only do the minimum maintenance to it to allow me to build what I *really* want using it!). Net net, don't take my configuration as gospel; YMMV.
