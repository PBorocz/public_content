    | [**Nano**](posts/nano/index.md)         | Essentially tweets (_eXcreta_ perhaps nowadays?), i.e. short off-the-cuff observations and comments.                                              |
    | [**Micro**](posts/micro/index.md)       | Short form text, either stand-alone or as part of the process of conversion to long-form (aka Macro) pieces. Usually less than 5 minutes to read. |
    | [**Macro**](posts/macro/index.md)       | Fully fleshed out long-form essays, >10 min. reads.                                                                                               |
    | [**Projects**](posts/projects/index.md) | Commentary/Brainstorming/WIP on various projects before they merit a dedicated [github](https://github.com/PBorocz) repo.                         |
    | [**Tech**](posts/tech/index.md)         | Reference posts with up-to-date information on my technology environment...                                                                       |
