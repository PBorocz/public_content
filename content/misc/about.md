## Why Is The Site Named *Flirting with Neutrality*?

Many (many) years ago, my hour-long daily commute time was taken up listening to  [CNBC's Squawk Alley](https://www.cnbc.com) morning market coverage (yes, in the car, we DID have satellite radio in those days ;-).  When markets were essentially unchanged (or _flat_ in the vernacular), Bertha Coombs opined once that markets were "*flirting with neutrality*".

I noted this wonderful aphorism at the time and it came back to me in our current climate. In my case, it succinctly describes a predilection to holding socially **liberal** but economically **conservative** views. Thus, not easily fitting anywhere on the classic Republican-Democratic spectrum (albeit leaning heavily small and large "D" democratic for the majority of policy issues).

Thus, [Flirting With Neutrality](https://peterborocz.blog) it is!

## Why now?
I've never "blogged" before but upon retirement and watching the world go by, this seems as good a time as any to get started.

## Platform(s)
I tried [Nikola](https://getnikola.com), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), [Pelican](https://getpelican.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) but either couldn't "grok" their mental models (or got caught in Ruby, gem, bundle installation hell for you_know_who).

Conversely, [Publii](https://getpublii.com) gave me a wonderful user-interface to edit content (in either various Markdown editors) and create a site interactively. However, this makes particular automation tasks essentially impossible.

[MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org) represents the perfect balance between enough granularity to create a customised site while staying at a command-line and editing with Emacs.
